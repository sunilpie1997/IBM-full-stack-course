#### COmmon software engineering processes

1. Requirements gathering
2. Design
3. Coding for quality
4. Testing
5. Releases
6. Documenting

7. ##### Requirements

   1. SRS encompasses collecting and documenting the set of requirements
      that the software needs to adhere to.
   2. It may include a set of use cases that determine business needs and user flows that the software needs to implement.
   3. Software requirements can be classified into 4 broad categories:
      1. Functional
      2. External and user interface
      3. System features
      4. Non functional.

8. ##### Design

   1. Transaforming requirements into code.
   2. Break down components into set of related components to define software architecture encompassing User interface, API's, database design, etc.

9. ##### Coding for quality

   1. Features:

      1. Maintainiblity
      2. Readiblity (also well documented)
      3. Testablity
      4. Security <br>

   2. Following a set of coding practises during development:
      1. Following coding standards.
      2. Using linters to detect errors.
      3. Commenting in the code itself to make it easy to read and modify.

10. ##### Testing

    1. Process of verifying whether software matches given requirements and free of bugs.

       1. Identifying errors, gap or missing requirements.
       2. Ensuring reliablity, security, performance and efficiency.
       3. Can be automated or manual.<br>

11. ##### Releases

    1. When a version of software comes into picture, it is called release.
    2. Different type of releases:

       1. Alpha:
          1. select stakeholders
          2. may contain errors.
          3. Preview of functioning version
          4. Design changes may occur
       2. Beta:

          1. all stakeholders
          2. Meets requirements
          3. User testing

       3. Genearl availablity
          1. Stable
          2. All users

12. ##### Documentation

    1. Software documentation should be made available to both technical and non technical persons on how it works.
    2. Types of documentation:

       1. System documentation (technical users): Readme files, inline comments, architecture and design documents, verification information and maintanence guides.
       2. User documentaion (end users): user guides, manuals, instructional videos, online help, etc
